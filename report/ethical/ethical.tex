\chapter{Ethical Considerations}
This project is largely an experimental demonstration of how a recent method for calculating Greeks can be efficiently implemented on a GPU. We have not had to consider many ethical issues during the development of this project.

However, it is worth noting that all estimates produced by the software can be fully explainable and any errors easily debugged - unlike solutions that come from the neural networks.

Financial exchanges and markets around the world have strict regulations designed to prevent misconduct by participants. This software is not designed, and is highly unlikely, to give any user an unfair, or otherwise illegal, advantage over other market participants.
