abstract = {This paper develops a Monte Carlo simulation method for solving option valuation problems. The method simulates the process generating the returns on the underlying asset and invokes the risk neutrality assumption to derive the value of the option. Techniques for improving the efficiency of the method are introduced. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the procedure and additional applications are suggested.}

 abstract = {If options are correctly priced in the market, it should not be possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and short positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

abstract = {Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are successfully used for high-dimensional integrals arising in many applications. To understand this success, the notion of effective dimension has been introduced. In this paper, we analyse certain function classes commonly used in QMC methods for empirical and theoretical investigations and show that the problem of determining their effective dimension is analytically tractable. For arbitrary square integrable functions, we propose a numerical algorithm to compute their truncation dimension. We also consider some realistic problems from finance: the pricing of options. We study the special structure of the corresponding integrands by determining their effective dimension and show how large the effective dimension can be reduced and how much the accuracy of QMC estimates can be improved by using the Brownian bridge and the principal component analysis techniques. A critical discussion of the influence of these techniques on the QMC error is presented. The connection between the effective dimension and the performance of QMC methods is demonstrated by examples.}

abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for non-graphics applications. From early academic proof-of-concept papers around the year 2000, the use of GPUs has now matured to a point where there are countless industrial applications. Together with the expanding use of GPUs, we have also seen a tremendous development in the programming languages and tools, and getting started programming GPUs has never been easier. However, whilst getting started with GPU programming can be simple, being able to fully utilize GPU hardware is an art that can take months or years to master. The aim of this article is to simplify this process, by giving an overview of current GPU programming strategies, profile-driven development, and an outlook to future trends.
► The article gives a step-by-step guide to profile-guided optimization of graphics processing unit (GPU) algorithms. ► The article gives an overview of current GPU hardware and programming techniques required to achieve peak performance. ► The article gives an overview of current and future trends of GPU computing.},

abstract = {The price of a derivative security equals the discounted expected payoff of the security under a suitable measure, and Greeks are price sensitivities with respect to parameters of interest. When closed-form formulas do not exist, Monte Carlo simulation has proved very useful for computing the prices and Greeks of derivative securities. Although finite difference with resimulation is the standard method for estimating Greeks, it is in general biased and suffers from erratic behavior when the payoff function is discontinuous. Direct methods, such as the pathwise method and the likelihood ratio method, are proposed to differentiate the price formulas directly and hence produce unbiased Greeks (Broadie and Glasserman, Manag. Sci. 42:269–285,
1996
). The pathwise method differentiates the payoff function, whereas the likelihood ratio method differentiates the densities. When both methods apply, the pathwise method generally enjoys lower variances, but it requires the payoff function to be Lipschitz-continuous. Similarly to the pathwise method, our method differentiates the payoff function but lifts the Lipschitz-continuity requirements on the payoff function. We build a new but simple mathematical formulation so that formulas of Greeks for a broad class of derivative securities can be derived systematically. We then present an importance sampling method to estimate the Greeks. These formulas are the first in the literature. Numerical experiments show that our method gives unbiased Greeks for several popular multi-asset options (also called rainbow options) and a path-dependent option.},

@article{gpca,
	abstract = {Many problems in derivative pricing can be formulated as high-dimensional integrals. Many of them do not have closed-form solutions and have to be estimated by numerical integrations such as Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Since the quasi-random points used for QMC simulation have perfect projections at the first few dimensions, reducing the effective dimension of the integrands can improve the efficiency of QMC. In this paper, based on the first-order Taylor approximations of the functions at Gaussian sample points, we propose a new general method based on principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the effective dimensions of the functions. Rather than aiming at decomposing the covariance matrix of the Brownian motions as in the traditional PCA, the new method implements PCA on the gradients of the functions at sample points and then an orthogonal transformation is found to reduce the effective dimensions. Numerical experiments show that by using the new dimension reduction method, a significant efficient improvement of QMC can be achieved on pricing exotic options and mortgage-backed securities.},
